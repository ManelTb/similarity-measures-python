# Similarity Measures for 2D Curves (Python)

## Project Overview
This is a university project focused on analyzing and comparing similarity measures
for 2D curves and trajectories using Python.

## Similarity Measures Used
- Dynamic Time Warping (DTW)
- Discrete Frechet Distance
- Curve Length
- Area Between Curves
- Point Cloud Matching (PCM)
- Euclidean Distance
- Manhattan Distance
- Chebyshev Distance
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)

## Tools and Technologies
- Python
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- similaritymeasures
- Jupyter Notebook

## Files
- `similaritymeasuresprojet.ipynb`: Python implementation and examples
- `presentation/`: Project presentation (PDF)

## Academic Context
University coursework project in Data Analysis and Exploration.

## How to Run
```bash
pip install similaritymeasures numpy matplotlib
